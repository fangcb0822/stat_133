Organization of Directories and Files

- The directory [code](../code) contains the R scripts that generate clearned data, analyses, and images as well as the file [functions.R](../code/functions.R).
- The directory [rawdata](../rawdata) contains the original data files downloaded directly from the database [IBTrACS](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php?name=wmo-data).
- The directory [data](../data) contains the cleaned data (in csv) as well as the data to generate certain tables in analysis (in Rda).
- The directory [images](../images) contains all the plots generated for analysis purpose.
- The directory [report](../images) contains the related files (Rmd and pdf) for the final report.
- The directory [resources](../resources) contains any downloaded resource files related to this project (in this case none).
